\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello everyone!\
\
I was develop a messenger for texting with all. It works only with swagger because I don\'92t can develop a front-end part.\
\
Mostly it exists for my portfolio.\
\
If you want to take this project and edit if for yourself, sell my about this! I really interested this. Also if you can use my DB: DataAccessLayer has migrations for Postgre. Use it if you need this.\
\
This messenger can:\
Create and add user in DB, \
Login with help by Jwt and cookie,\
Edit user\'92s all datas,\
Get all users, and get them by filter,\
Send message,\
Get chats wit al messages\
\
If you have an advice for edit my program to better side - send me, I really friendly\
\
Good luck!}
