Hello everyone!

I was develop a messenger for texting with all. It works only with swagger because I don't can develop a front-end part.

Mostly it exists for my portfolio.

If you want to take this project and edit it for yourself, sell my about this! I really interested this. Also you can use my DB: DataAccessLayer has a migrations for Postgre. Use it if you need.

This messenger can:
Create and add user in DB, 
Login with help by Jwt and cookie,
Edit user's data,
Get all users, and get them by filter,
Send message,
Get chats wit all messages

If you have an advice for edit my program to better side - send me, I really friendly

Good luck!
